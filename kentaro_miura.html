            <section id="tribute-info">
                <p> Kentaro Miura was born on July 11<sup>th</sup>, 1966 in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan to two
                    artists who were students at Musashino Arts School. His father created storyboards for commericals
                    and his mother was an art teacher, which resulted in a naturally constructed artistic environment
                    that inspired him to draw. Thus, in 1973, he began experimenting with drawing in a notebook.</p>
                <p>From the very young age of 10 years old in 1976, he created his first manga for his schoolmates in a
                    school publication, called <em>Miuranger</em>, which spanned 40 total volumes. However, this was
                    never published in any official formats, so original artwork and storyline is unknown. In fact, one
                    image is commonly mistakened to be from Miuranger, but is actually from his one-shot
                    post-apocalyptic story, <em>Noa</em>.</p>

            <p>His second manga was written in 1977, called <em>Ken e no michi (剣への道)</em>, which is <em>The Way of the
                    Sword</em> in English. This was his first work drawn using Indian Ink.</p>
            <p>Then, he became more serious with his artwork. During middle school, he began to use rasters for
                his
                work, and he self-trained to utilize professional drawing techniques such as screen tone. Afterwards, he
                enrolled in an artistic curriculum during high school where him and his friends published in school
                booklets.
                It was during this time that Miura began to learn about doujinshis (fan art works of existing manga).
            </p>
            <p> In 1982, Miura published his first doujinshi in a fan-produced magazine. He befriended fellow manga
                artist Koji Mori. Together, they co-authored a science fiction doujinshi that was sent to Weekly Shonen
                Sunday. However, it never made through the last round of selections. </p>
            <p> At the age of 18, Miura briefly worked as an assistant for George Morikawa, who is the author of Hajime
                no
                Ippo. Since Miura already had such a natural talent for art, he was dismissed, for there was
                nothing more Morikawa could teach him. Around this time, Miura already had a dark warrior with a
                humoungous
                sword in his portfolio.</p>
            <p>In 1985, he was accepted into Niho Daigaku university where he began his artistic career. He started both
                <i>Noa</i> and <i>Futatabi</i> during this time, which was submitted to the Shonen Magazine. As a
                result, he
                won a prize
                for best new author for Futatabi and had Noa published in the magazine toward the end of the year.
                However,
                due to a difference in opinion with one of the editors, both mangas ended quickly.

            <h3 id="section-two"><em>Kentaro Miura's Manga Career</em></h3>
            <p class="indent-fix"> The best manga ever, Berserk, first appeared in 1988. This version is what we now
                call Berserk: The
                Prototype - a 48 paged manga that won Miura a prize from a Manga School.</p>
            <p class="indent-fix">Not long after this, he finished his doctorate in 1989 and began another manga called
                Ourou, otherwise
                known as <i>King of the Wolves</i>. According to Miura, this was based off of a script from Yoshiyuki
                Okamura,
                the manga writer of <i>Fist of the North Star</i>. This manga was published in Japanese Animal House in
                issues
                5 and 7 of 1989. </p>
            <p class="indent-fix"> In 1990, there were more releases to follow up on <i>Ourou</i> called <i>Ourou Den
                    (Legend of the Wolf
                    King)</i>,
                which was also on a script written by Okamura.</p>
            <p class="indent-fix"> That same year, Japanese Animal House also released the first ever publication of
                Berserk, which did not
                begin to gain traction until the Golden Age Arc. </p>
            <p class="indent-fix"> In 1992, he started the manga <i>Japan</i> with Okamura, which appeared in Animal
                House that year with
                stand
                alone manga volumes released the following year. However, it was toward the end of this year that Miura
                decided to dedicate himself to continuing his manga, <i>Berserk</i>.</p>
            <p class="indent-fix"> Later on, due to Berserk's popularity, Miura would eventually manage the production
                of the 25 episode
                animated
                series for Berserk in 1997, which was aired on Nihon TV in Japan.</p>
            <p class="indent-fix"> Presently, Berserk has had a lot of success in Japan and around the world. It has
                released 40 volumes
                and has
                earned Miura the Award for Excellence at the 6th installment of the Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize- winning
                him a total
                of 1 million yen.
            </p>
            <p class="indent-fix"> In 2013, Miura wrote and illustrated another manga named Gigantomakhia, a 6 chapter
                mini-seies. In that
                same year, a movie adaption of <i>Berserk</i> named <i>Berserk: The Golden Age Arc I - The
                    Egg of the King</i> released and won Silver at the Oregon Film Awards.</p>

                    view themselves. An earthquake comes and ghost Carthaginians bring them (along with some college
                    students) to the future where the Japanese have emigrated to other countries and have become
                    oppressed. I wanted to explain this more simply but this actually sounds complicatedly
