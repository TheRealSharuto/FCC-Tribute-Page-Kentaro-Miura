# 📜 Kentaro Miura Tribute Page

This is a single page describing the life of late Kentaro Miura, the manga artist/Author of the popular manga Berserk. 

When the news got out that Miura had pass, I was devastated. However, it is also quite amazing that he has left so many masterpieces behind. 

If you do not know yet, Berserk has come back and will be updated regularly. If you are a broke college student like me, perhaps try reading it on readberserk.com. However, I highly suggest you try purchasing it somewhere.
